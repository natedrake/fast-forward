2. Install composer using the [Windows installer](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe)
3. Make sure dependencies are up to date:

        composer install

4. Edit the file `ff.bat` and change `ffpath` to the folder you put fast-forward in.
5. Copy `ff.bat` to a global path so that it is always available on the command line.

### Linux

        cd ~
        git clone https://github.com/phparsenal/fast-forward.git

2. [Install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx):

        curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
        mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

3. Make sure dependencies are up to date:

        composer install

4. Afterwards make the `ff` command available globally by adding this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_aliases`:

        alias ff='. /path/to/fast-forward/ff.sh'
